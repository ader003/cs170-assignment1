\section{Introduction}

This assignment is the first project in Dr. Eamonn Keogh's Introduction to AI
course at the University of California, Riveside during the quarter of Fall
2017. The following write up is to detail my findings through the course of
project completion. \\ \\ It explores Uniform Cost Search, and the Misplaced Tile and
Manhattan Distance heursitics applied to A*. My lanugage of choice was Python
(version 3), and the full code for the project is included.

\section{The Code}
Relevant files:
\begin{itemize}
\item nPuzzle.py
\item TreeNode.py
\end{itemize}

Running is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
python3 nPuzzle.py
\end{verbatim}

\section{Comparison of Algorithms}
The three algorithms implemented are as follows: Uniform Cost Search, A* using
the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* using the Manhattan Distance heuristic.

\subsection{Comparison of Algorithms on Sample Puzzles}
There were six puzzles of varying ''difficulty'' given to implement. The easiest
of the six is a trivial puzzle (already the goal state) and the hardest puzzle
is impossible to solve (the goal state, but the position of tiles 7 and 8
swapped). While the feature of user-inputted puzzles supported, this write up
will only use Dr. Keogh's in examples.


\subsection{Mathematic Verification} %some proof that the actual space complexity is
                                %consistent with the theory space complexity

\section{On Utility of the Two Heuristics}

\section{Closing Thoughts}
The most interesting thing to me was realizing that as impractical Breadth First Search and
Depth First Search are in the context of real world problems, they are still the
heart of most practical feasible algorithms used for such real world problems.

\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Comments}

Comments can be added to your project by clicking on the comment icon in the toolbar above. % * <john.hammersley@gmail.com> 2016-07-03T09:54:16.211Z:
%
% Here's an example comment!
%
To reply to a comment, simply click the reply button in the lower right corner of the comment, and you can close them when you're done.

Comments can also be added to the margins of the compiled PDF using the todo command\todo{Here's a comment in the margin!}, as shown in the example on the right. You can also add inline comments:

\todo[inline, color=green!40]{This is an inline comment.}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.
